# Contributing to EME

Thank you for your interest in the **EME (Experimental Mesh Environment)** project! We are building a "human coral reef" — a digital tool for offline, decentralized community care.

## Principles of Development
When writing code for EME, keep these core principles in mind:

1.  **Offline-First**: Everything MUST work without the internet. No CDNs, no external APIs.
2.  **Simplicity**: The code should be understandable by a junior developer. Avoid over-engineering.
3.  **Low Tech**: The system must run on old laptops and cheap Android phones (via Termux).
4.  **Aesthetics**: The design should be vibrant, organic, and premium. Not "hacker green terminal", but "living reef".

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-idea`.
3.  **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m 'Add amazing idea'`.
4.  **Push to the branch**: `git push origin feature/amazing-idea`.
5.  **Open a Pull Request**.

## Initial Setup
See [README.md](./README.md) for installation instructions.

## Translations
We aim to be fully bilingual (UA/EN). If you add UI text, please update the dictionary in `app.py`.
