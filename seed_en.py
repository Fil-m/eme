    "manifest-en": ("EME Manifesto", """EME — People for People
EME is people building a world where help is the norm and interaction is daily practice.
We believe: everyone can be a node of support, and every action matters.
We prove: a new reality is possible today — locally, concretely, by ourselves.

1. Purpose
We create a network of mutual aid where people are not isolated but connected by action.
Technology serves people, not the other way around.
A small action, if reproducible and shared, changes the world.

2. Principles
Action weighs more than words — do, and the world will see the result.
Horizontality — no center, no bosses. Everyone is equal in the capacity to help.
Transparency — resources, knowledge, experience are open to all.
Reality over utopia — we create functioning systems here and now.
Subjectivity of everyone — you are important and can make decisions.
Reproducibility — our practices are easy to repeat in any city, in any context.
Self-sufficiency — each node strives for maximum autonomy in basic needs (food, energy, knowledge, health, work). We exchange skills and resources so everyone becomes more independent, not more dependent on the system.

3. Action and Interaction
We unite people through common projects, training, and events.
We use technology, space, and knowledge as tools of support.
We expand the network through shared values and practice, without hierarchy.
We record experience and pass it on so new nodes appear.

4. Vision
We strive for a society where:
help is natural, not a feat;
trust is practiced daily;
technology and people cooperate;
the support network grows, and isolation disappears;
every action becomes a brick of a new reality.

5. Call
EME exists for you to join.
For you to become a node, not a spectator.
For us to create a new world together — here and now, by ourselves, every day.
EME — people for people.
This is emergence: when we are together, something greater arises than us separately.
And this is just the beginning. This is for this movement. For indexing actions."""),

    "responsibility-en": ("Responsibility", """1. Nature of Responsibility
In EME, responsibility is not punitive, but stabilizing.
It serves to protect the network and its nodes, not to burden individual participants.
Responsibility is the system's immunity, which localizes consequences and allows the network to grow.

2. Local Responsibility
Each node answers only for its specific contribution, without the need to "pull the whole system."
This allows:
- saving energy and resources of participants
- avoiding overload and burnout
- increasing network resilience

3. Reproducibility and Replication
All EME practices can be easily repeated.
Each participant, having received support or joined a project, becomes a node that:
- reproduces practices
- passes on knowledge and experience
- expands the network without concentrating the load on a single node

4. Feedback
The consequences of a node's actions are recorded transparently so that:
- participants see the effect of their action
- the system adapts practices to new circumstances
- learning happens without punishment

5. Node Support
The network protects its nodes:
- provides resources for recovery
- shares knowledge for effective work
- stimulates mutual support
Each node remains active and capable of acting for a long time, which increases system stability.

6. Short Formula
EME Responsibility = localization of consequences + node protection + reproducibility of practices
→ system grows, nodes remain strong, network self-replicates"""),

    "protocol-en": ("Interaction Protocol", """EME Interaction Protocol (v1.0 — for network self-replication)
This document describes simple, repeatable steps that every node can perform independently.
Goal — the network grows horizontally, without a center, through clear action algorithms.
Every new node becomes capable of creating new nodes.

1. Entry of a New Node
(onboarding — 3–5 minutes + 1 day)

Step 1. Acquaintance
A person finds EME (through a friend, post, #EME1on1, channel/chat).
Reads the short manifesto + Node Codex (1 page).
Asks questions in the general chat or directly to the inviting node.

Step 2. Self-initiation (enters themselves)
Writes in chat/channel:
"Hi, I am [name/alias]. I want to be an EME node. Ready to do at least 1 support action daily. My first contribution: [briefly about self or why joining]."
Receives welcome + links to main chats/channels/templates.
(Optional) Adds self to node list if there is a shared doc or bot.

Step 3. First Week — Adaptation
Follows the 1/1 rule daily.
Reads/views 3–5 posts with experience (lessons, stories).
Asks in chat: "How can I help now?" or "What does the community need?".
Invites at least 1 person (friend, acquaintance) — simply drops link to manifesto.
Result: new node active in 1–3 days, without "approval" from anyone.

2. Transfer of Knowledge and Experience
(so the network doesn't lose memory while growing)
Every action/project/help is recorded briefly:
What did I do → For whom → Result → What worked / didn't work (1–3 sentences).
Example: "Helped with CV — person got interview invite. Worked: specific examples from vacancy. Didn't work: text too long."
Where to record (node choice):
- General channel/chat with tag #EMEexperience or #EMElesson
- Separate doc/notion/github (if tech-nodes)
- Stories/post with #EME1on1 (for visibility)

Weekly one node (anyone) does "weekly digest":
3–5 most useful lessons/templates of the week → posts in general channel.
This creates "collective memory" without a center.

Transfer Templates:
"How I organized..." (meeting, resource collection, online help)
"Ready template: [name]" (copy-paste to repeat)
"Mistake of the week: [desc] → how to avoid"

3. Recording Mistakes and Lessons
(so network learns, not repeats)
"No blame" rule: a mistake is a resource for all.
When something went wrong (burnout, conflict, failed help):
Write briefly: "Lesson: [what happened] → why → what to do differently".
Add tag #EMElesson or #EMEmistake.
If conflict — use rule from Codex: speak directly, calmly, without audience.

Monthly (or when 10+ lessons accumulate) — "collective review":
Anyone can initiate post: "Collecting top 5 lessons of the month".
Discuss 10–15 mins in voice chat (if available).
Update "Lesson Base" (one doc or channel-pin).
If lesson critical (e.g. boundaries, safety, burnout) — make it "permanent pin" in chat.

One phrase-reminder for all nodes:
"I record my experience → share it → network learns → new nodes start faster."

This protocol is not dogma.
Each local node/chat can adapt it (e.g., add bot for recording, separate channel for lessons).
Main thing — repeatability and transparency: everyone knows what to do for network to grow itself.
EME — emergent network.
Protocol makes it resilient and scalable."""),

    "support-en": ("Node Support", """EME Node Support Document
(Collective care — basis of network resilience)

EME is a network where nodes don't burn out because mutual support is built into the system.
We are not heroes, we are part of a living organism. If a node depletes — the whole network weakens. So we create mechanisms that protect participants, save resources, and allow the system to work long and stably.

1. Resources for Recovery (time, energy, knowledge)

- **Right to Pause without Guilt**
  Any node can take a break (day, week, month) without explanations and without feeling they are "letting down". Just write in chat: "Taking a pause" or "Need rest" — and it's normal.

- **Daily/Weekly Recovery Practices**
  Built into Node Codex:
  - Minimum 1 day a week without any EME activities.
  - Regular: sleep, movement, hobbies, nature, time with loved ones (not for network, for self).
  - Collective recommendations: short meditations/breathing, lists of "things that recharge me" (share in chat).

- **Recovery Knowledge Resources**
  In Experience Board separate section/tag #EMErecovery:
  - Templates "How I exited burnout"
  - Lists of free resources (meditation apps, podcasts, articles)
  - Collective recs: books/videos on sustainable activism, collective care, burnout prevention.

- **Material Support (if needed)**
  If node in crisis (financial, emotional) — can anonymously/openly ask: "Need help with [specifics]". Network reacts on "give what you can, take what you need" principle.

2. Load Control Methods

- **"No more than I can" Rule**
  Each node defines its own limit:
  - How many 1/1 actions per day (can be 1, not necessarily more).
  - How much time per week (e.g., 2–5 hours max).
  - If exceeded — signal self: "Too much, reducing".

- **Buddy System**
  Desirable to have 1–2 "buddies" (close nodes) with whom:
  - Weekly short check-in: "How is your resource now? 1–10".
  - If someone falls below 4–5 — buddy reminds of pause, offers help, or takes over part of actions.

- **Role Rotation**
  In local groups/events: roles (host, notes, chat mod) change weekly/monthly. No one "carries" everything constantly.

- **Network Alarm Signals**
  If you see node writing often "burnout", "hard", "can't keep up" — write privately: "See it's tough for you. How can I support? Maybe a pause?". No pressure, no judgment.

3. Mutual Support Channels

- **General Chat/Channel — "SOS Signal"**
  Separate channel or tag #EMEsupport or #needhelp:
  - Write: "Emotionally drained", "Need to talk", "Financial tight spot".
  - Answer: who can — offers time, word, resource. Anonymous also possible.

- **Voice Support Circles**
  Weekly/Monthly: online circle "Resource Check" (30–60 min).
  Format: everyone in turn says energy level + what's needed. Rest listen, offer support.

- **Local Pairs/Small Groups**
  In city/region: create small chats 3–6 people for deeper support (daily check-ins, walks, "meal train" — when someone in crisis, others bring food/help).

- **Collective Care for Events**
  Before big event/gathering: check "Who is tired? Who takes pause?".
  After: mandatory "debrief + gratitude + rest".

One phrase we repeat:
"Network is strong when nodes are alive. Self-care is care for all. Care for another is care for self."

EME protects participants not by rules "from above", but by culture:
- It's normal to ask for help.
- It's normal to refuse.
- It's normal to rest.

This makes us resilient.
Together we don't just survive — we emerge stronger."""),

    "expansion-en": ("Expansion Plan", """EME Network Expansion Plan
(v1.0 — for self-replication without center)

Goal: network grows emergently — from independent node actions, without central management.
Each node can launch expansion itself, using only available tools (chat, socials, friends, local space).

1. Attracting New Nodes
(how to launch invitation wave without spam)

Step 1. Personal Invitation (most effective, 80% growth)
- Daily/weekly: invite 1–3 people from your circle (friends, colleagues, neighbors, online contacts).
- Message template:
  "Hi! I'm in EME — a network where we do small support actions for each other daily. Helps get out of 'work-home' isolation. Want to see manifesto? [link] If you like — just write in chat: 'Want to be a node' — and you're in."
- After invite: add person to general chat + send link to Node Codex.

Step 2. Viral Content (for wider reach)
- Social posts (Instagram, Facebook, Telegram channels, X):
  - Stories/post with your daily action + #EME1on1 + call: "Do your action today — tag me, and I'll add you to EME chat".
  - Short video/text: "How I helped a stranger in 5 mins — and it started a chain".
- Hashtags: #EMUtogether #EMEnode #1action1day #peopleforpeople
- If post gains reach — someone else copies template and makes theirs.

Step 3. Automated Onboarding
- In chat/channel: pinned message with manifesto + Codex + Protocol + instruction: "To become a node — just write: 'Hi, I'm [name]. Want to be an EME node'. We will add you".
- No moderation: who wrote — is already a node.

2. Organizing Local and Online Activities
(so network feels alive, without "central" events)

Step 1. Local Meetings (offline nodes)
- Event template: "EME Circle" (1–2 hours, 3–10 people).
  - Place: park, cafe, coworking, apartment.
  - Structure:
    1. Intro circle (2 min/person: "What brought me to EME?")
    2. Action exchange (each shares 1 success/lesson)
    3. Planning: "How can we help each other soon?"
    4. Closing: each invites 1 person to next circle.
- How to launch: any node writes in chat: "Launching EME circle in [city/area] [date/time]. Who's with us?"
- Local copy: after meeting — short post in general chat with photo/lessons + template for repetition in another city.

Step 2. Online Activities (weekly/monthly)
- Voice chats (Telegram/Discord): "EME Support Hour" — topic: "What worries you now? How can we help?"
- Template: "Launching online circle Sunday 20:00. Topic: [e.g., burnout]. Join via link".
- Other formats: movie watch + discussion, Q&A, "rapid help" (each poses request — others answer in 2 min).
- Expansion: who participated — launches their own circle in their timezone/city.

3. Creating Local Practice Copies
(so practices duplicate in new cities/groups)

Step 1. Using Experience Board
- New node enters → filters "for new nodes" or "local events".
- Copies template: downloads Manifesto, Codex, Protocol, Board as copy (Notion: Duplicate) or creates own Google Doc/Telegram channel.
- Adds local chat: "EME [City/Area]" — and invites first people.

Step 2. Local Network Launch Template
1. Create chat/channel named "EME [your city/region]".
2. Pin: Manifesto + Codex + Protocol + link to general Experience Board.
3. Do first action: publish your daily help + invite 3–5 contacts.
4. Launch first circle/event by template above.
5. Record in general Board: "Launched local group in [city] — here's what worked".

Step 3. Growth Monitoring (centerless)
- Each node monthly posts in general channel: "My contribution to expansion: +X new nodes, +1 event".
- This creates social proof and motivates others.

One phrase-reminder for all nodes:
"I launch expansion in my circle — network grows itself. My action + template copy = new nodes in new city."

EME — not an organization, but a process. Each node is a seed of a new network. Expand where you are. This is just the beginning."""),

    "experience_board-en": ("Experience Board", """3. EME Experience Board
(Registry of practices, projects, and successful node actions)

Goal: ensure **reproducibility** — so any node can copy a successful practice in 5–10 minutes, learn from others' experience, and avoid repeating mistakes.
These are not wiki articles, but a living registry of short, ready-to-repeat blocks.

**Format: digital + visual (recommendations 2025–2026)**

Choosing tool that is:
- free or very cheap at start
- allows collaborative editing without center
- supports templates / databases / tags
- works offline or with good mobile access
- easy to scale (from 10 to 1000+ nodes)

**Best Tool Options (Comparison)**

| Option | Type | Pros for EME | Cons | Cost | Rec for Start |
|--------|------|--------------|------|------|---------------|
| **Notion** | Cloud, collab | Templates, filters, nice UI, mobile app | Fully cloud, free limit ~1000 blocks | Free start | **Best Start Choice** |
| **Google Sheets/Docs** | Spreadsheets | 100% free, offline access, exportable | Less visual | Free | If max simplicity needed |
| **Obsidian + Git** | Local MD | Fully offline, privacy, graph | Needs Git/Sync setup | Free | For tech nodes |

**Rec for EME 2025–2026: Start with Notion**

**Structure of Experience Board**

Create Database (Table/Board):
- Title: "Quick CV help in 15m"
- Type: Online Help / Event / Template, etc.
- Difficulty: 1–5 min / 1 hour / Day+
- Author: Node Name
- Date
- Tags: #job #health #techhelp
- Result: Success / Lesson
- Short Desc: what did, for whom
- Template: step-by-step recipe
- Links/Files
- Lessons: what to improve

**Process:**
- Did useful action → fill template in 2–5 min.
- Add #EMEexperience in chat + link.
- Weekly/monthly "Top 5 practices".

**Example:**
**Quick CV Help**
Type: Online
Diff: 15–30 min
Tags: #job
Result: Success
Template:
1. Ask vacancy + current CV
2. Compare keywords
3. Edit 3–5 points
4. Send version + explanation
Lesson: shorter explanation is better.

This ensures **self-replication**: new node enters → filters "for new" → copies template → acts → adds result → network learns."""),
