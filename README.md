# EME — People for People

**EME** (Experimental Mesh Environment) — a decentralized care network. People help people. Technology serves people.

We build a world where:
- Help is normal, not heroic
- Trust is practiced daily  
- Every action matters
- The network grows horizontally, without a center

---

## Quick Start

### 📱 Android (Termux) — Recommended

**Important:** Install Termux only from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), **NOT Google Play**.

✅ **Що саме ставити в F-Droid:**
- 🔹 **Назва:** Termux
- 🔹 **Опис:** Terminal emulator with packages (by Fredrik Fornwall)

```bash
# One-line install from existing node:
curl -O http://<NODE_IP>:5000/install.sh && bash install.sh
```

**Or manual install:**

```bash
# 1. Update and install basics
pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python git -y

# 2. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Fil-m/eme.git
cd eme

# 3. Install system dependencies (for image processing)
pkg install libjpeg-turbo zlib libpng freetype clang make libwebp -y

# 4. Install Python packages
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
LDFLAGS="-L$PREFIX/lib" CFLAGS="-I$PREFIX/include" pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run
python app.py
```

Open on your phone: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 💻 Windows / Linux

##  Creating a Mesh Network

To connect with others and sync data, see the detailed [Mesh Network Guide](./MESH_GUIDE.md).

Quick version:
1. Enable mobile hotspot on your Android
2. Others connect to your WiFi
3. Share your IP (shown in terminal) or QR code
4. Sync with "📷 Scan QR" or manual IP entry

---

## Philosophy

EME is inspired by nature — like coral polyps creating massive reefs. Individually small, together unstoppable.

- **Horizontality**: No center, no leaders
- **Transparency**: Open code, open data
- **Reality**: Works here and now, offline
- **Reproducibility**: Easy to replicate anywhere

Read the full vision: [MANIFESTO.md](./MANIFESTO.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Termux: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'`

This means Pillow wasn't installed correctly. Run:

```bash
pkg install libjpeg-turbo zlib libpng freetype clang make libwebp -y
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
LDFLAGS="-L$PREFIX/lib" CFLAGS="-I$PREFIX/include" pip install Pillow
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

Verify:
```bash
python -c "from PIL import Image; print('Pillow OK')"
```
